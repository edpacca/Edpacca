![The finished well.](miniatures/well/well_alpha.webp)

I have recently been getting into a fantasy tabletop game called [Frostgrave](https://www.ospreypublishing.com/ca/osprey-games/wargames/frostgrave/), and before you ask - yes, it's about wizards. Think of two or more 10-character parties tactically fighting over treasure. The board is much smaller than wargames such as [Warhammer](https://www.warhammer.com), and typically features a lot more terrain elements which make the game very tactical.

There are certain scenarios in the book which introduce a bit of flavour to each game, and some require specific terrain features. This particular piece is for the scenario 'The Well of Dreams and Sorrows', where Wizards may gain additional experience points for drinking from the well - which is usually situated in the centre, the most contested area of the board.

In typical fashion I started the build the night before the game, so we actually played with the most basic foam creation. The upside to this was I decided to really take my time after that and just followed my gut with what felt good - and the final product is, _well_, pretty great I think!

# The Build <FaIcon icon="hammer"/>

![](miniatures/well/well_0.webp)

## Initial Base <FaIcon icon="hill-rockslide"/>

I wanted this well to sit on a base so I could integrate it more into the environment. I started by cutting out a rough wobbly shape from cardstock. I used a sharp knife to chamfer the edge of the carstock to give a smooth transition from the base to the tabletop.

I took some cork sheets a cut a few rough shapes, tearing the edges to give some rock-like texture. These were stacked up to create a raised centre for the well itself. I tore the edges further, roughly gauging with my knife to try to blend the layers a bit.

## Bricks <FaIcon icon="cubes-stacked"/>

The bricks were cut from XPS insulation foam. This was done on the fly with no real measuring - to introduce some natural variationm and because I'm lazy. These were textured with balled up tinfoil and hot glued into a a ring. I built up the layers using similar sized blocks, but would cut pieces of varying shapes to fill any gaps. This resulted in a more cobbled-together look to the piece, which I think makes it feel more realistic and adds to the grungy aeasthetic I wanted to go for. To expand on this I also glued a few pieces on the ground at different angles to look like the thing was literally falling apart - like some ancient tree roots had pushed the stones out of place over the centuries.

## Wood <FaIcon icon="tree"/>

I don't know what you call the wooden axel thing that holds the bucket and, honestly, for this build I wasn't using reference images. I just went with what felt right. I carved up a disposable chopstick and melted two holes in the top layer of bricks to secure the two wooden posts. A third section connected the two and was secured with super glue.

At this stage, I was initially planning to just add some rocks and sand and call it a day, but something awoke within me... A voice whispering in the darkness. A little flame of inspiration. Sod it, let's make this well "well good". So I decided it needed a few extra details.

## Smoothing out the cork <FaIcon icon="mound"/>

Next I took some milliput expoy putty and smoothed out the edges of the cork. I left a few gaps where the textured edges could poke through resulting in a more realistic and irregular surface.

## Bucket <FaIcon icon="bucket"/>

The bucket was kitbashed from old [Ogre Kingdoms](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Ogre_Kingdoms) barrel bits. I don't have any photos but it wasn't particularly interesting or complicated. The handle is made from a bent paper clip superglued to the bucket.

Inside the well I glued a glass [cabochon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabochon) (a cool and very specific word - basically a glass lump with a flat back). I used these previously to make tokens for D&D, but here it just provided a bit of weight to the build, and let me glue the bucket down whilst having some of it visible over the edge of the well. I thought perhaps it could be used for a water effect but in the end it all just got sprayed over! You have to draw the line somewhere!

## Chain <FaIcon icon="link"/>

For some reason, this detail was probably the bit I was most excited about. I think it just sells the piece. I found the smallest hobby chain I could from the craft store; 1.5mm links. I carefully wrapped it about the wooden axel and left exactly the right amount of extra so the bucket looked like the chain was under tension. I think the weakest detail on this build is the ring attaching the chain to the bucket, as it just sort of touches the last link of the chain - but as I said previously, got to draw the line somewhere. It still looked awesome.

## Serendipitous Chemistry? <FaIcon icon="flask"/>

Next was one of those serendipitous events that occurs all the time in crafting with little to no planning - I used extra thin super glue to hold the chain in place on the axel, and some dropped down onto the foam walls of the well! This is bad, because CA glue [(cyanoacrylate)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanoacrylate) <a href="#chemistry" onclick="window.location.href = '#chemistry';">'melts' the XPS foam<sup>1</sup></a>. But the effect was actually perfect as it just so happened to align with where I'd glued the fallen rocks, and it even created some rough texture. The resulting look was as if the wall had been smashed by an errant spell or the blow of a warhammer - awesome!

### <a name="chemistry">Pub chemistry <sup>1</sup></a> <FaIcon icon="flask"/>

**_Caveat - "Pub chemistry" implies this is the rubbish I would be happy (and likely) to spew forth excitedly over a pint of ale, and should be taken as such. I 'cite' Wikipedia and other pages as general and digestible references for particular concepts. Most scientific papers are sadly hidden behind paywalls anyway. Do *not* quote this as it simply represents my intuition. After all I am building a well out of chopsticks for my plastic wizards... That being said, fire me an email if you have a better explanation and I'll happily quote and credit you!_**

As far as chemistry goes it is interesting to me that this reaction occurs, beacuse we can use CA superglue on plastic minis no problem. Plastic minis are typically made from HIPS (high-impact polystyrene) and XPS foam is extruded polystyrene. Polystyrene does chemically break down in the presence of a solvent such as acetone, but the CA glue is solventless. CA glue simply reacts with moisture which causes the cyanoacrylate molecules to [_polymerise_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerization) forming long chains. These chains are internally quite strong, and adhere to surfaces resulting in the 'glueing' action.

So why does CA glue melt XPS foam? It would appear that it may be due to the heat given off by the CA polymerisation, rather than chemically reacting. XPS foam is [much less dense that HIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polystyrene), which reduces the 'melting point' to ([75 - 100 °C](https://www.epstec.com/what-is-the-melting-point-of-eps-epp-epe-xps/)). 'Melting' is not strictly accurate as PS is a thermoplastic meaning it will not melt and reform, but this temperature is sort of where XPS may start to lose its structural integrity. HIPS on the other hand will be irrevocably decompose [above 250 °C](https://estyrenics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/E-Styrenics-Polystyrene-HIPS-MSDS.pdf). The CA polymerisation is exothermic which means it gives off heat - potentially enough to even [burn skin](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7335472/) suggesting it could be enough to affect the XPS foam.

Therefore my best interpretation is such: the thin CA glue seeps into the porous XPS foam, reacting with the moisture in the air within the pores. The water is consumed by the polymerisation process and thus causes a slight negatic pressure in the pores. This couples with the heat that is given off by the CA polymerisation to collapse the foam, reducing it to a blob of plastic.
