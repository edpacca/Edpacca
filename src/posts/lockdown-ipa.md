I like IPAs and I tried my hand at brewing one during Lockdown. I wanted something around 5% ABV but with the hoppy punch of a stronger IPA. I made 5 different batches with varied results, but they generally tasted good! My friends who were forced to drink them said they enjoyed them...didn't they?!

I brew all these from LME ([Liquid Malt Extract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt#Malt_extract_types)) because I simply didn't have the setup to properly extract from grain - we had a tiny oven with a terrible hob. The advantage of this is the recipe tweaking was all down to the hops so I could keep a consistent backbone throughout my experiments. I arbitrarily chose a combination of [Coopers Light LME](https://www.diybeer.com/us/thomas-coopers-light-malt-extract.html) and [Mangrove Jack's LME](https://mangrovejacks.com/products/pure-liquid-malt-extract-light-1-5kg) which worked well to give a nice rich colour and flavourful, balanced backdrop to the bright hoppy flavours. I chose [Mangrove Jack's US West Coast M44](https://mangrovejacks.com/products/m44-us-west-coast-yeast-10g) for the yeast to aim for that crisp IPA finish.

N.B. I have written this up from hastily scrawled notes taken during the brews so some ideas and tasting notes are incomplete! I have a few photos but not many, as I never intended to write this up like this! But we live and we learn.

## The Recipe <FaIcon icon="scroll"/>

- started timer (t is time in minutes)
- <span class="highlight">t=0</span>
    - added bittering hops
- <span class="highlight">t=35</span>
    - flavouring hops
- <span class="highlight">t=40</span>
    - pitched yeast to a jug of 35Â° Water
- <span class="highlight">t=50</span>
    - added 2/3 of aroma hop pellets
- <span class="highlight">t=57</span>
    - added 1.2 kg Malt 2 to pasteurise
- <span class="highlight">t=65</span>
    - added final 1/3 of aroma hops
- start cooling wort (no chiller - took a long time)

## The Brew <FaIcon icon="jar-wheat"/>

- O.G. = 1.040
    - initial taste was very sweet and very bitter
- pitched yeast at 26-27 Celcius
- bubbling started and krausen formed around 24h mark
- temperature stable at 20 C
- krausen dropped back in around day 3
- bubbled for 5 days
- temperature remained at 20 C until bottling
- bottled on 11/08/2020 (UK Date format) 21 days after pitch
    - F.G. = 1.015
    - ABV approx. 3.2%
    - taste had cloying bitterness and not much aroma at this stage
    - bottled with 1 carbonation drop per 500ml bottle
- tasted on 15/08/2020
    - less bitter
    - still heavy and sweet
    - no foam
- main taste on 20/08/2020
    - little bitter
    - better foam
    - not as heavy
    - ...but not bad (according to notes!)

This is unfortunately all I have from my notes, but I remember the beer improved a lot over time. After 3 months the taste was fairly consistent between bottles, with a hoppy taste despite there being less of an aroma that I would have liked.
