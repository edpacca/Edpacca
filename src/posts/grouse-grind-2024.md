## June 2024

It's late in the year. [Last year's running challenge](running-up-that-hill) was a success but I had got started right away! This year has so far been consumed with a big cross-continent move and I haven't been running very much. But I'm getting the itch again now we're more settled in Canada. Fear not, getting things done in the nick of time is what we do here.

A simple one this year - run the [Grouse Grind](https://www.grousemountain.com/grousegrind). It's basically an 800m staircase. Last year was an accumulation challenge whereas this one is harder to track, but I think I'll make a few attempts and record roughtly how far I can get up without stopping. There are actaully two routes to the top - I already hiked the [BCMC Trail](https://www.grousemountain.com/BCMC) which is a more rugged, direct ascent through the forest. Similar length, but might be more prone to twist an ankle - although _definitely_ more fun that climbing stairs. So we'll see what we end up doing.
