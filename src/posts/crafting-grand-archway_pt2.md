![The finished second side](miniatures/arch/painting/p8_1.webp)

The first side was looking awesome at this point and I was really looking forward to getting that pink and white foam painted! Because it took so long to do I decided to shift tac on the second arch design and go for something simpler.

<ImgHoverToggle
    src="miniatures/arch/plan/arch2_drawing.webp"
    srcHover="miniatures/arch/plan/arch2_parchment.webp"
    alt="design for the second arch. (hover/click to toggle!)"
/>

This is the first drawing I did - it still felt <Footnote text="elegant" ref="1" anchor="elegant"/> and gothic, whilst the lack of curves would help a lot with building. Armed with the lessons learned from crafintg the first design (twice!) I felt confident this one would come together a lot faster.

I had already glued on the two pillars that surround each arch when I did the first two sides. The advantage of this was that I didn't have to measure these bits - I just cut the arch to the width between them!

<ImgGrid
    imgs={[
        { path: "images/miniatures/arch/build_2/s14_0.webp" },
        { path: "images/miniatures/arch/build_2/s14_1.webp" }
    ]}
    caption="The easiest way to make sure everything fits.."
/>

Instead of the slight inset I had on the first arch, this one had thinner 'bricks' lining the whole interior - I just used two thin strips from the white 1/4" foam and glued them inside the pillars.

this was continued on the inside of the archway - I just glued on the pink bricks first leaving a thin line for the white lining piece. The pink bricks were a lot easier to get sized up as there were no curves! Then I glued on another pair of lining white foam on the 'exterior' side of the pink arch bricks. It was already looking great, but do you remember the key rule about making archways look realistic from [part 1](/crafting-grand-archway_pt1)? Layers! so I slapped on a second piece of white foam, slightly thicker than the first to create that depth and BAM! It was most of the way there already.
