The Deathwing terminators are iconic models from the Dark Angels range - but the bright bone coloured armour always feels a bit sqeaky clean to me. Additionally most approaches to making this more realistic and "grimdark" tend to move towards the grey side of things, whereas I want to keep my army's palette in the warm spectrum.

In particular I was aiming for a kind of parchment-like colour and maybe even give some texture to the armour to give it a truly ancient feeling. These are the oldest and most revered members of the chapter after all! Now I'm not a great painter by any means but I have a lot of fun experimenting and getting the effects that I like, and I'm really happy with how this armour came out. I'm confident that over time this will evolve and improve as I gain experience, but for now I give you my first Deathwing recipe.
