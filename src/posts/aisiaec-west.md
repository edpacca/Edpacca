Very shortly after Jon joined we'd scheduled ourselves a day of recording at [Tonegarden Studios](https://tonegarden.co.uk/) to lay down some tracks. We had 3 that we recorded all together as a full band, and the title track *West* just needed drums, as everything else I had recorded on my own at home. This is sort of poetic as it's just Ali and myself on this one, the very first members. Jon did amazingly well considering he'd only heard the songs a week or so beforehand. I think we re-recorded a few of the keys later on but a grand time was had by all. These songs are not very coherent with what the circle became later on, but *West* stayed around for a while and *Gaziltelyu* was eventually re-written by our future bassist Oli and features on our [2019 EP Meridian](/aisiaec-meridian). A very close friend of mine, Joe, very kindly did the mixing on this. Recording live all together has its limitations but he did a cracking job with what we had, and we're really happy with it.
