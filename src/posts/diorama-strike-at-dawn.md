About a year ago I finished my first diorama project. As far as miniature dioramas go it is fairly static, but I'd like to think it tells a bit of a story. I have always loved miniature dioramas, since I first opened the pages of the Lord of the Rings Warhammer rule book, and saw how they made the rivers, rocks and little walls from cork and stones. I think it was important to keep it simple for the first one, and we can get more ambitious as time goes on!

# The Mini

I wanted to paint a mini as a gift for a good friend. Initially I had no idea what I would do for him, so I went to my local hobby store and rummaged through the D&D bins until I found this guy. We hadn't known each other very long at the time, but I knew he liked [Hearthstone](https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-gb). The mini was a sort of boar-man with these epaulets that felt very on brand for a character in that world or [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/) - the same kind of colourful fantasy.

The cogs started whirring and an idea began to form in my head. I wanted to paint it in bright colours, purples and greens, and have him standing on a clifftop in the moonlight. I had never done any OSL (object source lighting) before but I wanted to try and capture that in the final piece.

I did find that the way the resin had been cast resulted in the details being slightly less crisp than other minis - and to to define the intricate bits was quite challening. But I was careful enough to capture the essence of what I wanted. I have learned my lesson about painting these kind of resin models! Nonetheless I forged on.

I tried to capture the colder moonlight by mixing a light blue into all my colours for highlights. I think it worked to tie the colours together but I don't think it particularly has much contrast. There aren't any shadows that one would expect to see when a light source is directly above.

# Telling a story with the Base

The real inspiration I had for doing this was trying to find something to be a plinth. I found the lid of a glass coffee container actually made a really cool plinth. The story I wanted to tell was this rogue Warlock/Druid fellow making a long journey, probably on a quest to do something nefarious. The scene shows him having set up his last camp, looking down into a deep valley at a town or village where his final task awaits him, to which he will attend first thing in the morning. I wanted to add the campsite in with a fire because I felt that my painting skills weren't quite enough to really emphasise this was a night time scene.

## Building <FaIcon icon="hill-rockslide"/>

I started with cork roughly stacked on the plinth as jagged rocks. I covered these in ultrathin superglue to harden them up. I wanted to stack up a pile to become a cliff top, whilst leaving a flat area for the campsite below.

![Cork piled up on the plinth.](miniatures/diorama-strike-at-dawn/base-0.webp)

I then smoothed out all the cork layers with polyfilla, which actually gave a really good rock texture - I'll bear that in mind for future endeavours. I selected an appropriate piece of orchid bark for a Lion-King-esque cliff edge, jutting out over the edge of a valley. This was supported by a build up of milliput, which I textured with the round side of a metal sculpting tool.

![Polyfilla and milliput](miniatures/diorama-strike-at-dawn/base-1.webp)

To make everything a bit more uniform I covered the piece in texture paste, leaving the odd rock jutting out here and there. I then laid out a cascade of round rocks to match the somewhat cartoonish aesthetic that we were going for, and then some smaller rocks with some sand on top. I locked all of this down with a layer of ultrathin superglue, which has a very low surface tension and covers surfaces evenly.


![Texture paste does a lot of blending](miniatures/diorama-strike-at-dawn/base-2.webp)

After the rocks were down I started working on the campsite. It didn't need to be too complex, just a campfire and some gear resting nearby. I actually went back and forth a few times on how to achieve this, whether to include another weapon (he was already holding his staff though) or whether to try and make it more of a scene with some leftover food or something. Erring on the side of keeping things simple I ended up opting for a backpack, which comes from an [Ogre Kingdoms](https://www.warhammer.com/en-GB/shop/Gutbusters-Ogors-2018?queryID=44b2bd7346096639eb3e9524ee085fdc) kit (as they were called when I bought them), and a length of rope which possibly comes from [Frostgrave Soldiers](https://www.northstarfigures.com/prod.php?prod=7467).

The campfire is just pieces of sprue, shaved at jaunty angles to try to play into the wonky Hearthstone/WoW aesthetic.

I was already pleased with the outcome - it had this anticlockwise spiral moving up from the flattened area up to the edge of the cliff.

I wanted to draw the eye up from the campsite to the top of the cliff, and tried a few things before settling on a wee cat critter. This came from the [Frostgrave](https://www.ospreypublishing.com/uk/frostgrave-second-edition-9781472834683/) [Wizards II](https://www.northstarfigures.com/prod.php?prod=14244) sprue and really helps to tell the story of this piece. Cats tend to be associated with the night time, and I think it turns the perception of what this guy's mission might be - initially I was thinking a clandestine assassination but now perhaps he is delivering an important message, or maybe still in the darker realm of things, planting a shamanic cursed item within the Lord's abode...

# Painting the base

I wish I had more photos of this process, but I put it together quite quickly in the end. I began with watered down browns, purples, greens and even a bit of khaki just building up thin layers and blending the hell out of them.

Then to try to achieve a moonlight glow I built up a light blue drybrush over the whole backside of the piece. I also dusted the plants with the same blue to tie them into the piece, after they were attached of course.

![I tried to make it look like night time..](miniatures/diorama-strike-at-dawn/diorama-5.webp)

I tried to include more browns and warmer tones towards the front of the piece where the light was going to be coming from the campfire. I applied a very very thin layer of a dark red over the whole area, careful to try to leave shadows where they would be cast by the campfire. Then I painted a white over the campfire area before covering it in layers of orange, and building up to yellow. The logs themselves I tried to keep dark on the top. I tried to catch gentle bits of red under the cliff where light would flicker, and even put a tiny bit of red under the guy's hand.

Overall, it came out okay - I think it sells the effect I'm after. But I think if the piece had more detail I would need to do a better job of bringing contrast into the piece. We can imagine it's a cartoonish scene where there's more artificial light than in reality. Given the overall vibe I'm going for is whimsical fantasy, I'm pretty pleased!

My friend who this was a gift for is an artist. He has done commissions for MTG before and I think he nearly ended up doing some art for Hearthstone. So I knew his standards would be pretty high, but I think he appreciated the work that I put into this. We don't live in the same country anymore, so I'm glad I was able to give it to him before I left.

![All packed up!](miniatures/diorama-strike-at-dawn/diorama-packed.webp)

In the end I learned a lot by trying to challenge myself to go out of my comfort zone. I thoroughly enjoyed diorama building and already have ideas for more in the future, so watch this space.

![Actually quite like the starry background...](miniatures/diorama-strike-at-dawn/diorama-backdrop.webp)

I thought this background was corny when I was initially putting the images together, but coming back to it I kind of like it. I think next time I could paint something behind which would really add to the scene...

Alright, I'm off to bed. For at dawn...we strike!
