With both sides completed it was looking great, but definitely missing some panache. There were a lot of gaps between my non-perfect cuts of foam that needed filling, and the top needed some detailing. Wanting to consolidate the work I'd already done, before braving more foam, I grabbed some spackle and started slapping it into all the gaps.

## Gap Filling <FaIcon icon="trowel"/>

I had been using this _pink_ spackle for some other foamy bricky projects and found it needed a little bit of water to help spread it evenly, but not too much otherwise it is hard to control. Nonetheless, I applied some spackly to the top. I'm not sure why everything on this project before painting was pink and white but there you go.

Another huge benefit of applying spackle to your builds is the added weight - it really improves the overall sturdiness and helps everything stay solid. Hot glue does the same! Generally, more weight the better as it won't shift around as much on the gaming board.

I was careful not to go overboard as to ruin all the hard word I'd already done. On the corners, I let the spackle dry a little before scoring the brickline back in with a ballpoint pen. The hard part was leaving it alone to properly dry after this step, as it's easy to keep fussing with it - usually this way lies madness. Leave it alone!

Inside the angled archway required quite a lot of spackle to get the different layers of card and foam to blend smoothly. I only took photos it seems while it was wet, but everything looked much smoother after sanding.

## The Roof <FaIcon icon="house"/>

I wasn't really sure where to start on the top of the arch, but it felt like it needed more depth - something protruding at least as far as the archways. The problem was there wasn't enough room left to simply add to what was there so I needed to extend the height. I realise this made the gap-filling done on top redundant, but we at least gained some extra weight.

I started out really simple wih a thick slab of 1" pink insulaion foam and marked out 1" from each corner. I then cut strips of thinner foam-board and glued these in the center, leaving the 1" 'square' at each corner. I was winging it at this point, so there are no drawings of an intended design.

I felt really good glueing this slab onto the top of the build. If I had more hands I'd have taken a photo of the amount of hot glue I used as it was plentiful. I applied the glue to the upside-down slab and then pressed the upside down arch onto it. I found this way gave me more visibility for aligning things evenly - and I ensured I applied it quickly so I had a little bit of time to move the two pieces perfectly into place before the glue set. Insulation foam (as the name might suggest) actually does keep your glue hotter for a little bit longer which made this step a bit easier.
