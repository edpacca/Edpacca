AISIAEC formed in 2014 off the back of a gumtree advert I put out after I moved to Edinburgh. I didn't know anyone at the time and it was hard to vet the various responses, but I think I got lucky when I chose to meet up with Ali for a pint in Holyrood 9A. We hit it off right away and started jamming some songs that I'd been working on; Ali on Drums and me on Guitar. It wasn't long before Ali's mate Gaz got involved on the guitar and the three of us wrote and played tunes very happily for a little while. Eventually our dear friend Brendan starting playing bass with us and we worked towards recording our first EP. That was when I met Jon during a PhD meet-and-greet and we also hit it off - Jon played keyboard and came along for a rehearsal. We'd never considered having keys but it added such great dimensionality and depth to the music; and thus *The Circle* was formed.
