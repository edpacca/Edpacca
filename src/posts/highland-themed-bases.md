At the time of writing I've been living in Scotland for 9 years - it's a beautiful place with epic, rugged landscapes - especially the further north you travel. It can also be a harsh unforgiving place and I wanted to get the feel of that in the look of these bases. I came up with a fairly easy recipe that I think captures the vibe well. This tutorial just covers the painting as I tend to assemble bases differently depending on the squad. I may add a few assembly options at some point. The ones shown here are pretty much just small rocks and sand glued down.
