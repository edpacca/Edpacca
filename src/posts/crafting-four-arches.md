I like to keep bits of packaging that I think have potential as useful crafting materials. One such hoarded item was a squat oblong box, with a square footprint. Not that uncommon but unusual enough for me to hang onto it. The idea to build a four sided archway came from my partner - I liked it as a concept for a piece of terrain because it can allow line of sight through, and can have minis placed both underneath and on top.

# Plan

<script>
    import ImgHoverToggle from "../lib/components/ImgHoverToggle.svelte";
</script>


<ImgHoverToggle src="miniatures/arch/plan/arch_drawing.webp" srcHover="miniatures/arch/plan/arch_parchment.webp">
</ImgHoverToggle>
