**_my most involved terrain project to date..._**
![The finished archway](miniatures/arch/arch_0.webp)

I like to keep <Footnote text="bits of packaging" anchor="hoarding" ref="0"/> that I think have potential as useful crafting materials. One such hoarded item was a squat oblong box, with a square footprint. Not that uncommon but unusual enough for me to hang onto it. The idea to build a four sided archway came from my partner - I liked it as a concept for a piece of terrain because it can allow line of sight through, and can have minis placed both underneath and on top.

    ]}

I decided to make two different arch designs for the piece to introduce some variety.

**Arches rock** - I have been collecting photos of different gothic archways in the wild, mostly on churches. Something I had never noticed prior to this was how important 'layering' the trim around the archways is to the aesthetic. Some of them can be incredibly over the top but it really works! However, I wanted to give myself the grand look without going overboard so I settled for 3 layers, between square pillars.

That's about it as far as planning goes. I had so much fun on this project just following my nose, trying out different approaches. I think one learns a lot this way, and I find it builds momentum. Maintaining motivation is a big part of completing these more ambitious projects. Onto the build!

# Build

**A key skill of any terrain crafter is identifying _'potentially useful'_ pieces of rubbish/garbage/trash. However, if living with a partner, you must also become proficient in convinving _them_ that there is some use for it. The problem is you just don't know exactly what it could be yet...**
