The first step is to get a mixture of modge-podge (pretty much PVA glue) and black paint slathered over the whole thing. After it dried I applied at least another coat (possibly 2). I removed the tiles for this and did them seperately. This provides a thick a protective layer that is needed if I want to use this on the tabletop. It simultaneously provides a black base coat from which to start building up colour. I batched this step with some other terrain pieces that I had been working on, like the stairs you can see in the background.

The top of the thing took a lot more layers before it was looking nice and smooth, but it was very satisfying once it was dry.

I had time to use the piece in a game of [FrostGrave](https://www.ospreypublishing.com/us/discover/gaming-resources/frostgrave-stargrave/). It certainly adds some height, although the scale could perhaps be a bit smaller.

And there you go. The piece was finally finished. It took a lot longer than I thought, but I learned a ton and the hours sunk were well worth it. When life feels like a lot, having a hobby that takes you to another world is such a blessing. So next time you're having a rough week, I'd highly recommend making a miniature gothic foam archway from scratch... does wonders.

The piece is nice and weighty due the unspeakable amount of hot glue used to attach all the foam bricks. It's an odd size in the 28mm scale though, but then again all my recent foam creations are slightly oversized. I am going with the idea that my frozen city that I am crafting for playing [FrostGrave](https://www.ospreypublishing.com/us/discover/gaming-resources/frostgrave-stargrave/) was once lived in by giants, who mysteriously vanished and left the place frozen in the ice - only now, a millenia later, beginning to thaw.

I finished this in January 2025 but it took me a while to get around to writing it up. I have had the arch sitting somewhere nearby me on display for about a year, and I am pleased whenever I look at it. But writing this has reminded me just much how much work went into it. A glorious journey of discovery, flow state and hot glue.
